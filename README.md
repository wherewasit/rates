# The current rates for the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension
The following rates apply when using the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension:

| Operation                         | Charge in credits                          |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Index content                     |                                          1 |
| Search history                    | 0.05 + 0.00025 x number of stored contents |
| Search content for the first time | 1.05                                       |
| Search content searched before    | 0.05                                       |

The charges are in multiples of 0.01 credits. The rounding is always in the user's favor.

# Example
Suppose the user has 150 videos in the history. The calculation to determine the cost of searching the history is: 0.05 + 0.00025 x 150 = 0.0875. The user will be charged 0.08 credits.

# An important note
