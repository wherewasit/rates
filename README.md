|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Index content                     |                                         1 |
| Search history                    | 0.05 + 0.0002 x number of stored contents |
| Search content for the first time | 1.05                                      |
| Search content searched before    | 0.05                                      |

# Example
Suppose the user has 180 videos in the history. To determine the cost of searching the history we compute 0.05 + 0.0002 x 150 = 0.086. The user will be charged 0.08 credits.
