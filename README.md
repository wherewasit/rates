# The current rates for the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension
The following rates apply when using the WhereWasIt Chrome Extension:

| Operation                         | Charge in credits                          |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Index content                     |                                          1 |
| Search history                    | 0.01 + 0.00025 x number of stored contents |
| Search content for the first time | 1.01                                       |
| Search content searched before    | 0.01                                       |

The charges are in multiples of 0.01 credits. The rounding is always in the user's favor.

# Example
Suppose the user has 180 videos in the history. To determine the cost of searching the history we compute 0.05 + 0.0002 x 150 = 0.086. The user will be charged 0.08 credits.

# An important note
Please note that the rates are subject to change. Please refer to our [Terms and Conditions](https://github.com/wherewasit/terms#1-free-and-purchased-credits).
